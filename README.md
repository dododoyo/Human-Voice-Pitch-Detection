# Human Voice Pitch Detection 

- This is a GitHub repository that contains the project for the course of Digital Signal Processing. A course I took in my fourth year at Addis Ababa University.
- A `Digital Signal Processing` course delves into the fascinating world of manipulating and analyzing signals after they've been converted from analog (continuous)
  to digital (discrete) form. It's like turning continuous waves into building blocks to understand, extract information, and even transform them in innovative ways.
  Think of it as learning the language of digital signals, from analyzing their building blocks to designing filters that remove noise or compress data,
  and even building your own voice or image recognition systems!

- The course was taught to me by Mr. Belayneh Melka, who is an instructor in the School Of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology.

- The repository is organized into different files, each containing specific purpose. The algorithmic implementations are done with matlab,
  which is a programming language with a numerical computing environment.

- This repository is designed to accompany and enrich the learning experience for students enrolled in the Digital Signal Processing course at Addis Ababa University.
  It specifically focuses on a project implementing Human Voice Pitch Detection techniques.

- Whether you're currently taking the course or simply curious about applying DSP to analyze human voice signals, this project provides a valuable hands-on experience.
  Explore the simplest signal processing method to extract fundamental frequency (pitch) information from recorded data. Learn about techniques like time-domain analysis,
  frequency-domain analysis, and potentially explore applications.

- I welcome all contributions! If you have a different implementation for human voice pitch detection using various techniques or programming languages,
   I would love to see it! Please submit a pull request with your contribution.

- I hope you find this repository helpful and informative. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to contact me through [Github](https://github.com/dododoyo) or [Email](mailto:dolphinmulugeta88@gmail.com). Thank you for visiting this repository!
